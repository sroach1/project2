			<h1> 	Something special about Florida is that it is full of insane and crazy people. The worst of the worst. There are people who wrestle alligators and do insane and abnormal things.
			For example, a popular news headline is "Florida Man". An example of the type of behavior that goes on in Florida is to the right. Another example is "Florida Man Bites Off Neighbors Ear
			Over A Cigarette". Moving there would endanger you and you would for sure run into people who are doing unsafe and ridiculous things. 
			<br> <br>
			To contrast, California is ranked as the most diverse state in America, meaning it is a melting pot of many cultures and ethnitices. Florida isn't even top
			5 on that list.
